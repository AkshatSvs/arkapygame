# arkapygame
arkanoid clone

This game has 3 versions
1 - Arkanoid monochrome: simple graphic, randomly generated levels.
2 - Arkanoid polichrome: more colors, simmetric and a little more complex levels
3 - Arkanoid tiny: everything is tiny

There are still many bugs: the maxscore does not saves itself correctly. Sometimes the ball erase a part of the bricks without destroying them, because I choose not to update the screen completely, but just redrawing the ball and the bars with the same color of the background.
